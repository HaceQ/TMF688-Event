TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Event Management API

TMF Open APIs are exposed by components and micro-services called TMF Open API micro-services.
TMF Microservices already support the capability of publishing Events to subscribers using pub/hub pattern over REST (Hub..).
The current pub/hub subscribe pattern uses call-back based mechanism to deliver events to subscribers.
The Event API supports the large scale publishing and subscription of events.
